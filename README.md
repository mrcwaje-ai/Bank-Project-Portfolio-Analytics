Role Focus: Data Analytics | Banking Transformation | Portfolio Governance  

Portfolio governance and benefits realization analytics framework for a Philippine universal bank.

📌 Project Overview

This project develops an integrated analytics framework to strengthen project portfolio governance within a mid-sized Philippine universal bank.

The solution addresses three strategic challenges:
Monitoring project cost performance
Measuring realized operational benefits (with focus on FTE savings)
Supporting data-driven portfolio prioritization

It simulates a real-world transformation governance framework aligned with banking strategy execution.

🎯 Problem Statement

Many Philippine banks execute digital and process transformation initiatives but lack a structured analytics framework to:

Monitor cost performance in real time
Quantify realized manpower cost savings
Compare ROI across multiple initiatives
Support objective capital allocation decisions

Senior management often has limited visibility into:

Whether projects deliver measurable operational value
Which initiatives generate the highest ROI
How transformation budgets should be prioritized

This project addresses those governance gaps through integrated analytics modeling.

🧠 Analytical Approach

The solution integrates three primary datasets:

Project cost data
Salary benchmarks
Operational performance proxy data (Bank Marketing dataset)

The analytics pipeline includes:

1. Data cleaning and transformation (Python – Google Colab)
2. SQL-ready database development (SQLite)
3. Benefits realization modeling (FTE savings & ROI computation)
4. Portfolio scoring and prioritization framework
5. Executive dashboard development (Power BI)

The architecture mirrors a real banking analytics workflow from raw data to board-level reporting.

📊 Key Metrics Developed

The framework produces governance-level KPIs:

Cost Variance (Planned vs Actual Spend)
FTE Savings Estimation (Salary Benchmark × Efficiency Gain)
Project-Level ROI
Weighted Portfolio Score
Priority Ranking Index

These metrics enable structured transformation oversight and capital discipline.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy)
SQL (SQLite – Mode-compatible)
Power BI (Executive dashboarding)
GitHub (Version control & documentation)
