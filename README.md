# **Bank Project Portfolio Analytics**
Portfolio Health • Benefits Realization • Capital Efficiency

## Executive Overview

This project develops an integrated analytics framework to evaluate project portfolio performance, FTE savings realization, and capital efficiency within a banking environment.

The objective is to shift from traditional project status reporting toward value-driven portfolio governance.

Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, this project simulates how a Philippine bank can strengthen financial oversight of its strategic initiatives.

## Problem Statement

The bank lacks an integrated analytics framework to systematically monitor project portfolio performance, validate FTE savings realization, and prioritize capital allocation based on measurable ROI, resulting in potential capital inefficiency and overstated benefit projections.

## Data

- Project Management Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayarmohamedswilam/project-management

- Salary Prediction Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/salaly-prediction-for-beginer

- Bank Marketing Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing

These datasets were combined to simulate:
- Project financial performance
- Estimated FTE savings impact
- Revenue-related performance scenarios

## Methodology

1️⃣ Data Engineering — Python (Google Colab)
- Data cleaning
- Dataset merging
- Cost variance calculations
- FTE savings modeling using salary data
- ROI computation

2️⃣ Data Visualization — Power BI
- Executive-level dashboard design
- Portfolio Overview page
- Benefits Realization dashboard
- ROI distribution and prioritization visuals

## Insights

1️⃣ Capital Efficiency
Portfolio ROI is positive, but capital concentration in low-efficiency projects limits overall performance.

2️⃣ Benefits Realization Gap
Planned FTE savings exceed actual realization in several departments, signaling need for post-implementation validation.

3️⃣ ROI Concentration
Top-performing projects generate disproportionate value, suggesting reallocation opportunities.

4️⃣ Variance Risk
Cost overrun patterns are clustered, not random — enabling targeted governance intervention.

## Recommendations

1️⃣ Embed Value Governance in Stage Gates
Use ROI, FTE Realization %, and Cost Variance thresholds as continuation criteria.

2️⃣ Reallocate Capital Using Efficiency Score
Shift funding toward high-efficiency projects identified in the Prioritization Engine page.

3️⃣ Institutionalize Benefits Validation
Mandate 3–6 month post-implementation FTE savings validation.

4️⃣ Implement Early Warning Dashboards
Deploy variance heatmap to portfolio committee monthly reviews.

5️⃣ Enable Scenario-Based Capital Planning
Use What-If analysis to simulate ROI impact before approving incremental budget.

## Business Impact

If implemented:
- Improved capital productivity
- Stronger cost-to-income discipline
- Transparent portfolio governance
- Data-driven prioritization
