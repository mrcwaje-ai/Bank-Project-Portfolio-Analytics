# Bank-Project-Portfolio-Analytics
Portfolio governance and benefits realization analytics framework for a Philippine universal bank.

📌 Project Overview

This project develops an integrated analytics framework to strengthen project portfolio governance within a mid-sized Philippine universal bank.

The solution addresses three strategic challenges:

Monitoring project cost performance

Measuring realized operational benefits (with focus on FTE savings)

Supporting data-driven portfolio prioritization

It simulates a real-world transformation governance framework aligned with banking strategy execution.

🎯 Problem Statement

Many Philippine banks execute digital and process transformation initiatives but lack a structured analytics framework to:

Monitor cost performance in real time

Quantify realized manpower cost savings

Compare ROI across multiple initiatives

Support objective capital allocation decisions

Senior management often has limited visibility into:

Whether projects deliver measurable operational value

Which initiatives generate the highest ROI

How transformation budgets should be prioritized

This project addresses those governance gaps through integrated analytics modeling.

🧠 Analytical Approach

The solution integrates three primary datasets:

Project cost data

Salary benchmarks

Operational performance proxy data (Bank Marketing dataset)

The analytics pipeline includes:

Data cleaning and transformation (Python – Google Colab)

SQL-ready database development (SQLite)

Benefits realization modeling (FTE savings & ROI computation)

Portfolio scoring and prioritization framework

Executive dashboard development (Power BI)

The architecture mirrors a real banking analytics workflow from raw data to board-level reporting.

📊 Key Metrics Developed

The framework produces governance-level KPIs:

Cost Variance (Planned vs Actual Spend)

FTE Savings Estimation (Salary Benchmark × Efficiency Gain)

Project-Level ROI

Weighted Portfolio Score

Priority Ranking Index

These metrics enable structured transformation oversight and capital discipline.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

SQL (SQLite – Mode-compatible)

Power BI (Executive dashboarding)

GitHub (Version control & documentation)
